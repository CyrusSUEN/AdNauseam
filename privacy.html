<p class="p_special">We care about privacy. </p>

<p style="max-width:400px; margin:auto;">AdNauseam is a browser extension designed to obfuscate your browsing data to protect you from tracking and profiling by advertising networks. When browsing the Web, advertising networks track and analyze your browsing behavior. In order to make it harder for these networks to make meaningful predictions about you, AdNauseam simulates clicks on the advertisements served to you. </p>

</div>

<br>
<h3>ADNAUSEAM DOESN’T COLLECT YOUR DATA</h3>
<p>
We at AdNauseam do not collect any data about you or your browsing behavior. We do make it possible for you to inspect locally the advertisements for which clicks were generated. In order to enable this, the information about the advertisements that the extension detects are stored locally on your computer (within AdNauseam and in its  local log file). Whenever you use a 'Private Browsing' window in your browser, AdNauseam is disabled for that window and no information about that window is stored.
</p>

<br>
<h3>ADNAUSEAM’S LOCAL LOG FILE</h3>
<p>
The AdNauseam local log file is stored in your Firefox profile on your device. This log file does not contain page-visits, but only stores operations of AdNauseam, including the URLs of ads that AdNauseam detects. The AdNauseam extension does not transmit this information to any servers or third parties. In theory, other extensions and services (such as Firefox Sync) may attempt to access these data and could try to use this log to reconstruct parts of your browsing history. However, the log file does not provide additional information about you beyond what is already collected by websites third parties when browsing the Web. If you wish to completely disable all local logging by the extension, you may do so by selecting "DISABLE ALL LOGGING" in the AdNauseam settings menu
</p>

<br>
<h3>ADNAUSEAM’S ENVIRONMENT</h3><p>
AdNauseam makes use of an existing infrastructure for browsing the Web, specifically the Firefox Web browser and the AdBlock Plus extension. Your browser periodically checks for updates on all of your extensions, including AdNauseam. These checks take place outside of the control of AdNauseam. During such an update check, general information, such as browser version, extension version, operating system and your IP address, are transmitted by the browser and AdNauseam does not have access to these data. AdNauseam also requires that you have Adblock Plus installed. This extension has its own privacy <a target="new" href="https://adblockplus.org/en/privacy#logs">policy</a>.

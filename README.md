AdNauseam: a lightweight browser extension that blends software tool and 'artware' intervention to protect users from surveillance and tracking by advertising networks. AdNauseam works similarly to an 'Ad Blocker', but in addition to hiding advertisements, it simulates clicks on each identified ad (in a background thread), confusing trackers as to one's real interests. Simultaneously, AdNauseam serves as a means of amplifying users' discontent with advertising networks that disregard privacy and facilitate bulk surveillance agendas.

We conceptualize AdNauseam within a broader class of software systems that serve ethical, political, and expressive ends.  In light of the industry's failure to achieve consensus on a Do Not Track standard<sup>1</sup>*, or to otherwise address the excesses of network tracking,  AdNauseam allows individual users to take matters into their own hands, offering cover against certain forms of surveillance, profiling, and practices of discrimination. Taken in this light, the software represents a similar approach to that of <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot" target="_blank">TrackMeNot</a>, which attempts to relocate power in the hands of individual users, rather than vast commercial search corporations. For further information on this approach, please see <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/TMN-Howe-Niss08-ch23.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>.

#### How to install the development environment

##### Developing on Firefox

1. Checkout this repository: ``git checkout https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam.git``
2. Install the [Firefox Add-On SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation) guide
3. Open the commandline, cd into the Add-On SDK folder and activate it by running: ``source bin/activate``
4. Now we need a clean Firefox profile to work with. Open the profiles manager (on OSX: ``/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin  -P``)
5. Create and save a new profile
6. Now cd into your AdNauseam folder and run cfx run on your profile, like this: ``cfx run -p path/to/your/new-firefox-profile``
7. You would be informed that you need an ad blocker to run AdNauseam, install [AdBlock Plus]() or any other supported ad blocker.
8. Close the browser and run: ``cfx run -p path/to/your/new-firefox-profile`` again
9. You can now browse around and start collecting ads in the icon menu and the vault.
10. Enjoy, we are waiting for your pull requests eagerlyâ€¦

### <a href="http://rednoise.org/adnauseam">The AdNauseam website</a>

[Ad Nauseam] is a lightweight browser extension that helps protect users against surveillance and data-profiling by online advertisers and ad networks. It does so not by means of concealment and encryption (i.e. covering one's tracks), but instead, paradoxically, by the opposite strategy: noise and obfuscation. [Ad Nauseam] works silently in the background of your web browser by clicking all the ads on a page, thereby obscuring user interests in a cloud of decoy clicks. In light of the industry's failure to achieve consensus on a Do Not Track standard, [Ad Nauseam] allows individual users to take matters into their own hands, offering cover against certain forms of surveillance, profiling, and practices of discrimination.
